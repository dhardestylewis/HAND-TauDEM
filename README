Description
-----------
The Height Above Nearest Drainage algorithm calculates the vertical distance
   from a given pixel to its nearest drainage pixel.

The HAND script is run as:
hand-v2.sh <DEM_raster.input> <HAND_raster.output>

For example:
hand-v2.sh DEM.tif DEMdd.tif

Currently, every script must be placed in the same working directory as the
   input data to work correctly. This means that hand-v2.sh must be in the
   same directory as the following scripts to function:
   - hand-heads.py
   - hand-threshmax.py
   - hand-threshmin.py
   - hand-thresh.py
   - hand-weights.py

We also provide the following Python3 scripts for pre-processing and
   visualisation:
   - hand-buffer.py to create a DEM raster buffered by 100m for a basin
   - hand-vis.py to represent a HAND raster as GeoJSON and shapefile

Several basins of data are included here:
   in Texas:
      - Travis County by compositing HUC12s derived from HUC6s 120902 & 120903
   in Oromia, Ethiopia:
      - Awash
      - Baro
      - Ganale
      - Guder
      - Muger
      - Shebelle

For each of these basins, we provide the following files:
   as input:
      - a buffered DEM raster (ex *buf.tif or *buffer.tif)
   as output:
      - a HAND raster (*dd.tif)
   as visualisation output:
      - a GeoJSON (*dd.json)
      - a shapefile (all of: *dd.cpg, *dd.dbf, *dd.prj, *dd.shp, *dd.shx)
   as pre-processing input:
      - a buffered basin shapefile (*buffer.shp, etc)
   as deprecated input:
      - flowlines for hand-v1.sh (*_links.shp, etc)
   as deprecated visualisation output:
      - initial HAND representations with unusual binning (*dd.png)

The vertical unit for all of these data is meters (m).
